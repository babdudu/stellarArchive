# A VERY short reflection
Throughout this lab, I have not learnt much as I have already dealt with Github previously, however, I did learn about pull requests for the first time. I realized that it is a helpful tool for allowing changes, WITH given permission. This is so that no sudden unwanted changes occur without others knowing unless they check all the commits. When it comes to project planning, this tool is very useful, not just the pull requests but Github as a whole. Developers do not need to use multiple applications to develop an manage an app/system to keep everything in check. They can simply use Github to ensure coordination. 

# What was challenging/fun
The fun part about this lab was creating the pull requests and merging them. As I have never done so before, it felt nice trying something new compared to constantly committing and pushing the code. Fortunately, there was no challenging part. 

# If i had more time ..
IF i had more time I would have programed a prototype for the app, just for fun. To improve, I would have used a more creative idea, added more issues to make it look like an actual project, and as mentioned above, program a prototype for the app.
